# traineepoller-react

Front-end for the practice polling application made during the Nord Software trainee program. Made with React. (WIP)

## Installation

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm start` to build the unminified webpack bundle `bundle.js` and start the webpack development server. This also opens the development page in a browser.
* Start hacking!

## Distribution

To create the distribution build, run `npm run dist`. This creates a minified webpack file `bundle.min.js` that you can link in the distribution build of the application.
